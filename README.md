# meet-app

The meet-app is a progressive web application built with React hosted by a serverless function with AWS using the test-driven development (TDD) approach. Google Calender API is implimented to fetch upcoming events while the app can be downloaded for offline use. 

Users can search for a city and view a list of events hosted in the slected city. The app also allows a user to view charts that display how many events will take place on certain days as well as view the popularity of the event.
